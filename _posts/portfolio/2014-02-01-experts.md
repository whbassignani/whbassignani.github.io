### Project Summary

[Faculty Experts](http://www.bu.edu/experts) are BU professors who make themselves available to the media as specialists in certain fields. BU Public Relations oversees this program.

We expanded the original, barebones database of contact information into a searchable resource for journalists.

### Role

Designed and built the site from scratch. Inherited (and updated) the visual styles from the current [BU Public Relations](http://www.bu.edu/news) site.

### Highlights

1.	A typeahead search box on the homepage that filters professor names, fields, and specialties.
2.	The [Fields](http://www.bu.edu/experts/fields/) and [Topics](http://www.bu.edu/experts/expertise/) pages that let visitors browse the many experts working at Boston University.
3.	The profiles pages, which pull [“Newsmakers”](http://www.bu.edu/news/the-newsmakers/) content (BU Professors who are interviewed or featured in the media).
