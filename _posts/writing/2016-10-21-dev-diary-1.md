<p class="lede">When I was first learning to design and build websites, everything that I made was a pet project.</p>

I was ten years old and building video game websites—mostly about StarCraft. At the time, my mother was strict and never let me play. Making websites *about* games was the next best thing. (Even though all that gaming and coding <a href="/writing/into-the-west/">would prove valuable</a> in the end.)

Passion is motivating. It fuels the learning process in a way that pure academics cannot. Maybe there are people who can sit down with a programming book and digest the whole thing; I am not one of them. If I am going to learn something, I need to be building something with that skill.

Lately, I have been working on my first native app: a simple time-tracking app. It’s one of the simplest, most generic utilities. We’ll get into why I chose that, but it honestly didn’t matter *what* it was. As long as the project gets me started and keeps me interested, who cares that it’s not the next Uber/Instagram/Snapchat?

While I build my app, I’ll be documenting the design and build process in these “dev diaries.” Enjoy!

## The idea

First, let’s talk about the idea.

Going into this, I knew that it needed to be simple. Even small apps have hidden complexity. For example, take the humble note-taking app. Where do you backup the data? Do you have to build a syncing engine? If notes are shareable, do you need a user management system? If it’s got server-side syncing, you have maintenance costs; that needs a good pricing model. All these considerations are a bit much for a learning project.

My requirements:

1. It had to work offline, without a syncing system.
2. It had to be single-purpose—easier to design.
3. It had to be extendable to multiple platforms (mobile, desktop, wearables‽).
4. It had to be something that I would use everyday, i.e. dog food-able.

There were a few options: ambient noise apps, home inventory apps, weather apps. In the end, these were too complex. I also knew that I wanted to document the whole process in these “diaries,” so it couldn’t be so interesting that I’d worry about people stealing my idea.

A single-purpose, time-tracking app was the obvious choice. The iPhone already has an offline-only timer with generic functionality, so I had a reference product. Also, I need to track time daily for design work, meaning hands-on testing. And later on, it could become a mobile/desktop/wearable/web-based app with syncing.

For a first app—really, a *vessel* for learning iOS—this idea is low pressure. If it fails, no big deal. If I change my mind later, I didn’t sink months of work into something overly ambitious. And if I *do* finish it, the final product is something that I’ll use every day.

## Next steps

I’m taking a two-pronged approach: designing the app, and learning the process. Let’s talk about the development part.

I had a hard time finding somewhere to start. Go try a Google search for “learn iOS app development.” There are thousands of courses and tutorials, but all are some combination of shallow, out-of-date, or sketchy.

Over the summer, I was reading *The Swift Programming Language: Swift 3 Edition* from Apple. It reads like a cross between a computer science textbook and a brochure that wants to entice Objective-C holdouts into switching languages. The company also maintains a [developer site](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html), but it isn’t beginning friendly (IMO). Last year, I also bought a copy of *Cocoa Programming: For OS X (Fifth Edition)* by the Big Nerd Ranch, but it’s no longer current.

Udemy has an [iOS 10 development course](https://www.udemy.com/complete-ios-10-developer-course/) that I ended up buying. It normally retails for $200 (good Lord), but I purchased it 90% during a month-long sale. Keep your eye on that one. It’s all videos and hands-on experience, and the course instructor has a calming, British accent. We’ll see how that goes.

That’s all I have for now. If you know of other good iOS/macOS development courses of books that I should look into, please send them along! The easiest way is through Twitter; I am [@hawkeward](http://www.twitter.com/hawkeward).
